    so i don't have the time to actually go through your code and work out the css for you. but i can right off the bat see places that could use some improvement in the realm of UI (edited)
    <br>
    1. So on the header itself, I do like the colors used. The green on the teal background is a little probrablamatic because its a little hard to focus on, but then that would open up the can of worms called branding, thats a whole different conversation. However what I would try to improve on is the copy you have underneath your logo. like you say what you are, but not really what you do or why its something important and necessary. This is where you can come up with a short sentence oe two that's concise and to the point to describe your business . (edited)
    <br>
    2. your services section sort of stands out way too much against the simplicity of the rest of the website. they look like stock images. which they very well may be but the point is to make them look like they belong there. So maybe instead of stock images, use icons to represent the service. Another point is that I have no idea what these services are. their just vague images. No titles or anything to explain the user what they are about to click on. instead of the little magnifying glass which im thinking signifies to the user to click here to learn more, replace that with the name of the service. Like of course im gonna click on it to figure out what it is, but your job is the basically handhold the user through the experience so they feel like they know what they're doing the entire process. no guessing. (edited)
    <br>
    3. For the testimonials, I think that the two paragraphs are too close to one another. Maybe space them out to the position that your services start and end so that there is symmetry and the user's line of site isn't bouncing around back and forth.
    <br>
    4. I like that your contact us has a little indicator to show the user that its an intractable item. however you already have an underline there. but you add a second one. get rid of one. and keep that consistency with the services title further up the page (edited)
    <br>
    5. There is a lot fo redundancy here where you ask your user to input their information in order to contact you. Also. if the contact us button is a clickable item that automatically pulls up their email app. why would they need to input their information on the site? pick on and commit to it. also there is no need for each bar to have instructions there twice. I say keep the instructions that are within the bars for a cleaner look. The lines are too close between the words and the bars making it look cluttered.
    keep the same amount of spacing between the bars as well as the send button. the send button is touching the message bar.
    hope this helps! let me know if you have any other questions
