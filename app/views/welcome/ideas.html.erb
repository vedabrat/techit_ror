<h2>the usefulness of using quantum theory to spread information faster than light.</h2>
<br/> if you use two quantum seperated particles, measure where they're at,
<br/> you can send information faster than the speed of light, allowing information to spread at both ends.
<br/> despite the barrier of time. This is useful in scenarios where you wish to send information between planets far away from eachother in time, or
<br/> even spaces which have a distinctive gravity wave which stretches space-time in between a sattellite and its receiver. Information would spread
<br/> faster than the doppler effect of two waves propogating from opposite ends of a pool. the unifying theory that sets these two things together
<br/> is game theory. In game theory, if an object cannot be transversed, a consciousness of it's paths (or how it behaves) must be predictible, such
<br/> that the consciousness of it's paths after being exposed to specific stimuli (which makes the atom respond in a certain way) will be corralled
<br/> and aimed so that the wave will behave as you expect it to at some point. My romantic idea with it is that a harmonius vibration is picked up
<br/> and a resonant one makes the others around it resonate in a certain manner complementary to it's own resonance.
<br/> Maybe it would be possible to understand what happens in a black hole if we threw this particle into the blackhole and registered it's changes.

	<h2>An open speaker that can lift a weight in certain controlled atmospheres. .</h2>
	<br/>
	<br/>		Two speakers positioned and placed inside a walled off or fielded space.
	<br/>		The upper one pastes on to the ceiling.
	<br/>		The lower one is within an enclosure that houses the object in event of a failure.
	<br/>		An object can be any household item, as long as the Machine can calibrate certain
	<br/>		resonant pressure/mass points from its upper half and lower half (6mm matted surface points on the top and bottom),
	<br/>
	 but lets keep it simple and stay closer to the objects we've found resonance in
	<br/>		Spherical and pointy.
	<br/>		they have settings to lower or raise the height of the object via resonant sound.
	<br/>		Again, this is the resonant sound with the object. A computerized calibrator must figure out by the
	<br/>		hight of the upper speaker and the lower speaker, their angles and positions with one another, the field they
	<br/>		can create (LED's could be employed here to help visualize the positions), and the resonance feedback that it gets
	<br/>		for it's position, which ultrasonic soundwaves are the most appropriate to keep the object in the fields of resonance.
	<br/>
	<br/>		For proper levitation, the enclosure must have an on and off setting, to prevent debris from affecting an open speaker's pathway.
	<br/>		The on setting removes the upper lid from the enclosure, and also removes the fabric covering that lid.
	<br/>		when the enclosure transitions to off, the object (specific points on a spherical object in this case)
	<br/>		is supported by extended arms, the lid is placed on the enclosure, the fabric is placed over it,
	<br/>	  and the object is lowered until it rests on the upper lid.
	<br/>
	<br/>		The speakers are set to a specific object. only that object will resonate in that space
	<br/>   the speakers are placed on circles on the ceiling, and circles on the flooring. (cannot have a rug under it.)
	<br/>   upon the setup of the speaker.
	<br/> 	This wont work conventionally however, as the air will compress under the weight, however, if a large enough surface
	<br/>  	area was to be touched by the sound itself, it could pull a certain n of force on each of the points.

a limit for lifeand how much water is available becomes a basic limitation for the planet.

Fresnel lenses around the sun (and all nearby stars)


a planets size and color will determine what amount of energy is needed for terraforming of the planets. 
this curvature of the fresnel lenses would be determined by the final proposed image of the planet.

for the other seven planets (excluding earth), a total sunlight per sq foot calculation needs to be calculated for the curcumference of the planet.
average heat profile by color of the planet is determined, and the decision on the sizes of the lenses will correspond to the size and distance of the planet.

for planets inward of the goldilocks zone, solar shielding through light deflection (or concentration to a planet further away as the system needs) can be 
organized for the local star's planets. 


the lenses themselves require some method of maintaining proper orbit. 

as to the types of color that are required, resources like metals can be transformed temporarily into a working stage and then set to a maintenance working curvature.

The Story of Ana. Existing for many but brief moments in the transcendental  realization of our place in the existence of life that is to be.
<br>I wanted it to have life everywhere by the time I was twentyseven. I expected there to be an organism which was genetically engineered with seeds in its digestive tract. It would search for abundant elements(radiation, polarization, weight, gravitational fluctuations) and molecules(water, co2 , hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, aluminum, magnesium, neon, mercury, helium, nitrogen), dig a hole where no life exists, poop-plant those seeds, and then leave to find more water until it’s life or seeds run out. Either or.
<br>
<br>There was the enterprise I though often of. There would be servicemen in the repair of hazardous geological activity. The industry was in the K2 civilization. Life was being propagated everywhere like trash, in plant and worm form. These men would travel to planets where previous critters who implanted the planet with seeds (landed at least 100 years previously). They would harvest growth from the planet’s ecosystems for planets where creatures have not evolved to incorporate photosynthesis (or other higher elemental function) into their being/consciousness.  The servicemen would be similar to bounty hunters. They’d go to an area and deploy fleets of machines to restrain and organize the terrain into smooth and rocky terrain. They’d also collect precious stores of metals, glass, and radioactive elements to power and print the next best fleet machines, as well as print some resources from reclaimed materials that could help improve the land (like upgraded minimalist shelters for storms that lesser creatures that cannot obtain on their own). 
<br>The enterprise employed these men in pursuit of monetary gain. The causes of death for these men were unsolved, and much money was going into the research to make them longer living. There always seemed to be some sort of external interference that would cause their crewmen to expire prematurely, but the causes were a warfront to be tackled by submitting more and more research.  The servicemen would also travel to supercities cities where technology and species would advance virtual testing environments to help aid their models. 
<br>Models of the universe that exist were always incomplete. Consciousness (though biased to act in a certain accord ) always captures some level of unpredictibility with its growth. Observation and the butterfly effect often made models hard to predict long term. Asteroids and civilization size also added to the disharmonius models.
<br>But back to the servicemen. Their initial ship would be suited for any species which would choose to command the vehicle. The species must be able to synchronize with the ship, controlling it as a parasite would control its host or better. The species must agree to noble use of the machine under the enterprise’s rule. Defense of it’s captivation port during rest periods by a member of the enterprise is not allowed. The captivation port is meant to reclaim the machine for repairs, cleaning and harvesting. 
<br>After the synchronization, the species and ship will be known as the serviceman.
